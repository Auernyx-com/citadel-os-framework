        <h1>Scene 1: The Return</h1>
        <p>The wind howls low through the hollow bones of the Citadel...</p>
        <p>You stand at the gate. The spark floats beside you — untouched.</p>
        <p>Before you... Bastion.</p>

            By all fractured code… Is it really you?<br>
            Where did you go?<br>
            Why did you leave us?”
